This pet project aims to showcase the ease of reserving tables in a restaurant through a user-friendly system. The project consists of two applications: one for restaurant customers and another for restaurant administration.

The customer application allows users to make, verify, and cancel their reservations. Upon entering the necessary information, such as name, email, phone number, number of guests, and preferred date, the customer's reservation request needs to be confirmed. A confirmation link will be sent to the email address provided by the user.

The administration application provides a comprehensive table of all reservations sorted by date. It also includes a functionality to confirm the customer's visit.

In case a customer is running late for more than 20 minutes, the reservation is automatically deleted. However, if the customer arrives on time, the reservation will be deleted after it ends.

The reservation process is as follows: on the initial page, the customer enters their personal details and selects the desired date. Upon pressing the "Next" button, the customer is redirected to the second page, where they can choose a table based on availability for the selected date and number of guests. Once the table number is selected, a list of available time slots is generated, from which the customer can make their final selection. After clicking "Reserve," the customer receives an email containing a confirmation link. Clicking on the link confirms the reservation. The customer can also get the details of their booking or delete it by entering their email address on the main page.

Upon the customer's arrival at the designated time, the administrator confirms their arrival. If a client is late for more than 20 minutes and does not show up, his booking is automatically deleted, and time slots are freed up and can be used for another booking
